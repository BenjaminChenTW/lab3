Question B
1000:
sort(): 0 seconds
v1/v2 are different.
insertion_sort(): 0.01 seconds
v1/v2 are the same.

10000:
sort(): 0 seconds
v1/v2 are different.
insertion_sort(): 1.31 seconds
v1/v2 are the same.

100000:
sort(): 0.05 seconds
v1/v2 are different.
insertion_sort(): 127.67 seconds
v1/v2 are the same.

1000000:
sort(): 0.51 seconds
v1/v2 are different.
insertion_sort(): 12798.9 seconds
v1/v2 are the same.

We can see that insertion_sort() is more slower than sort().
